faq:
  - question: Do I need stone walls or arched doorways to pull this off?
    answer: Not at all. You can fake the Mediterranean vibe with earthy textures, soft lighting, and a well-placed olive tree.
  - question: What colors make a room feel Mediterranean?
    answer: Think sun-faded whites, terracotta, ocean blues, olive green, and that warm, dusty beige that makes you feel like you’ve been kissed by the sun.
  - question: What’s the difference between Mediterranean and coastal?
    answer: Coastal is lighter, breezier, and a little beachy. Mediterranean is older, warmer, more rooted. Less seashells, more old-world charm.
  - question: Can I mix it with modern furniture?
    answer: Yes, please. That contrast is what makes it feel effortless — clean lines mixed with old textures = magic.

Mediterranean design doesn’t try too hard — and that’s exactly why it works so damn well.

It’s not about matching or following a rulebook. It’s about a mood. The kind of mood where the air smells like thyme and your floor is still cool from the night before. You walk barefoot to the kitchen, pour yourself something cold, and everything just feels… easy. That's the spirit of this style.

If you’ve ever been to a village somewhere between southern Italy and coastal Spain, you’ve seen this look in real life. Crumbling [stucco](/glossary/stucco). Hand-painted tiles with chips in them. Arched doorways that don’t quite match. And always, always sunlight — bouncing off white walls and making the room glow a little.

The palette is straight out of nature. Creamy whites, sunbaked terracotta, sky blues, dusty greens, maybe a splash of ochre. Nothing glossy. Nothing plastic. This is a home that breathes — literally and metaphorically. Walls are often plastered, textured, maybe even cracked a little. You’re not fixing that. That’s part of the charm.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) tends to be worn in, not showroom new. A big wooden table with a dent from a dropped wine bottle. A woven chair that squeaks when you sit. A linen-covered couch that invites naps more than compliments. Everything has a history, even if you just got it from a flea market yesterday.

And the décor? Let’s be honest: it’s a little chaotic. A ceramic pitcher here. A stack of books that never made it to a shelf. Bowls of lemons just existing, not staged. Maybe a wrought-iron candleholder that you forget to light. It's not minimal, and it’s definitely not sterile. It’s emotional. It’s layered. It’s real.

[Lighting](/glossary/category/lighting-design) stays soft. Diffused. [Natural light](/glossary/natural-lighting) is the MVP, but when the sun dips, warm-toned lamps or candles pick up the slack. Harsh overhead lights have no place here — unless it’s a vintage [chandelier](/glossary/chandelier) with a story.

So no, you don’t need to live in a Spanish villa to go Mediterranean. You just need to embrace imperfection. Let your home feel a little sun-touched. Let the walls breathe. Cook with garlic. Keep fresh herbs by the window. Leave the windows open.

The rest will follow.

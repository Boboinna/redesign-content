faq:
  - question: What makes a space feel Scandinavian?
    answer: Light woods, soft textiles, clean lines and a kind of peaceful simplicity that just makes sense.
  - question: Is it the same as minimalism?
    answer: Close, but not quite. Minimalism is colder and stricter. Scandinavian design still leaves room for warmth, texture, and a few cozy extras.
  - question: How do I make my home feel more Scandi?
    answer: Start by decluttering. Then bring in natural materials, warm lighting, and at least one fuzzy throw you’d consider napping in.
  - question: What’s the deal with all the white walls?
    answer: Long winters. Little daylight. White walls reflect what light they *do* get — it’s functional *and* pretty.

There’s a particular kind of joy in walking into a room that doesn’t shout at you. Scandinavian design gets that. It’s the design version of someone who shows up to brunch on time, remembers your coffee order, and always has good lighting in their apartment.

Born out of practicality (read: endless dark winters), Scandinavian interiors are bright, pared back and cozy in a way that doesn’t try too hard. The palette is usually muted — [white](/glossary/white) walls, [pale wood](/glossary/wood-types), [soft grays](/glossary/gray) — like your space decided to take a deep breath and stop performing for Instagram.

But don’t mistake calm for cold. This isn’t the sterile kind of minimalism. It’s warm [minimalism](/glossary/minimalist). Like, yes, there’s probably a linen [sofa](/glossary/sofa) with clean lines and a [wool rug](/glossary/wool-rug) underfoot, but there’s also a candle flickering on the windowsill and a blanket that’s begging you to cancel your plans.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) is functional, but still beautiful. Nothing’s too fancy, but everything’s intentional. Even the [coffee table](/glossary/coffee-table) knows its job: hold your tea and look good doing it. Plants make frequent appearances (greenery = life), and there’s a serious appreciation for craftsmanship — not flashy, just thoughtful.

And then there’s the [lighting](/glossary/category/lighting-design). Scandinavians basically invented mood lighting. Overhead lights? Rarely. [Floor lamps](/glossary/floor-lamp), [table lamps](/glossary/table-lamp), tiny glowing corners? All day. The goal is to feel like you’re wrapped in a soft glow at all times — the kind that makes winter a little more bearable.

At the heart of it, Scandinavian design isn’t about style points. It’s about making your home feel like it’s looking out for you. And honestly, in a world that moves too fast and talks too loud, that feels pretty revolutionary.

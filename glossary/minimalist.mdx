faq:
  - question: Do I have to get rid of all my stuff?
    answer: No, but you *do* have to be honest about what you actually use and love. If it’s just sitting there collecting dust and guilt, it might be time.
  - question: What if I have kids, pets or a life?
    answer: Minimalism isn’t anti-living. It’s about making your home work smarter — closed storage, easy-to-clean surfaces and way fewer tripping hazards.
  - question: Can a minimalist home still feel cozy?
    answer: Absolutely. Cozy isn’t about clutter — it’s about textures, lighting, and letting the good stuff shine without all the noise.
  - question: Is white the only color I’m allowed to use?
    answer: Nope. White’s popular, but if warm taupe or moody charcoal feels better to you, go for it. The point is clarity, not conformity.

Minimalism has a rep for being kind of... sterile. Like you walk into a room and it’s all white walls, one sad chair and the feeling that you shouldn’t breathe too hard. But real minimalist design? It’s way more thoughtful — and way more livable.

It’s not about tossing everything you own and pretending your emotional attachment to that weird-but-lovable [side table](/glossary/side-table) doesn’t exist. It’s about editing. About asking, *“Do I actually like this?”* or *“Do I even notice this anymore?”* And if the answer’s “meh,” it might be time to let it go.

Minimalist rooms are calm — not because they're empty, but because they aren’t screaming at you from every corner. There’s a rhythm to the space. Breathing room. Negative space that feels like a sigh of relief after a long day.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) is clean-lined and usually low to the ground — not because it’s a rule, but because it feels grounded, like it’s not trying too hard. One solid couch that feels good to sit on. A table that doesn’t wobble or fight for attention. Everything’s chosen on purpose.

[Colors](/glossary/category/colors) tend to lean [neutral](/glossary/neutrals) — not because you can’t use color, but because a chill palette helps the eye relax. Add warmth with [woods](/glossary/wood-types), softness with throws, texture with rugs. Minimalist doesn’t mean flat. It means *intentional*.

There’s often a place for everything — and everything actually goes back to its place. Less stuff = less chaos = less cleaning. (Which, let’s be real, is maybe the best part of the whole thing.)

[Lighting](/glossary/category/lighting-design) matters, too. Lots of [natural light](/glossary/natural-lighting) if you have it, soft glows if you don’t. Lamps that cast a mood, not just brightness. You want the room to feel like an exhale.

At the end of the day, minimalism is about subtracting the noise so you can finally *hear yourself think*. It’s not aesthetic for the sake of aesthetics — it’s peace, on purpose.

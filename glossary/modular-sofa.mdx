faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between a modular sofa and a sectional?
    answer: A sectional has fixed pieces that go one way. A modular is like a choose-your-own-adventure couch — the sections can usually be rearranged however you want.
  - question: Are modular sofas good for small spaces?
    answer: Surprisingly, yes. You can break them up and reconfigure them, which makes moving around tiny living rooms a little less painful.
  - question: Do modular sofas come apart easily?
    answer: Sometimes too easily. One strong flop and that corner piece might slide like it's auditioning for a car commercial.
  - question: Can you add to a modular sofa later?
    answer: Yep. That’s one of the perks. New piece, new vibe, no full-couch commitment.

The modular sofa is the friend who’s down for anything. Rearranged the room for the third time this month? No problem. Got surprise guests and need extra seating? It’s got you. Bored of your current layout and want to make a U-shape instead of an L-shape just because? Go for it. Modular doesn’t judge.

Each piece — or "module" if you're feeling fancy — can live on its own or click together like a very cozy puzzle. You've got corner pieces, armless middles, chaise ends, [ottomans](/glossary/ottoman) that moonlight as tables... and if you're lucky, a matching spot for your cat who thinks they own the entire thing.

Let’s be honest: moving [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture) sucks. But a modular sofa? It’s a blessing on moving day. You don’t have to wedge a whole couch through a narrow doorway while screaming "PIVOT!" You just carry it one chunk at a time like an efficient adult who doesn’t want back pain.

The look? It can be sleek, it can be plush, it can be whatever your Pinterest board is having an identity crisis over this week. [Velvet](/glossary/velvet)? Sure. Linen? Absolutely. Giant cushions that swallow you whole? Yes, please.

But most of all, a modular sofa just *gets* you. Your changing moods. Your need to sit cross-legged, sideways, or half-upside-down. Your deeply specific habit of watching TV in a way that requires three [throw pillows](/glossary/throw-pillows) and one perfectly angled corner.

It’s not just a [sofa](/glossary/sofa). It’s a lifestyle choice. A shape-shifting commitment to comfort and chaos.

And honestly? We love that for you.

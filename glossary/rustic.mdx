faq:
  - question: Is rustic the same as farmhouse?
    answer: Close cousins, but not twins. Rustic is rougher around the edges — more log cabin than white shiplap.
  - question: Can rustic work in the city?
    answer: Absolutely. Exposed brick, reclaimed wood, cozy textures — you can build a cabin vibe anywhere.
  - question: Does everything have to be wood?
    answer: No, but wood is kind of the main character. Just balance it with natural textures like wool, linen, or leather.
  - question: How do I keep rustic from feeling dark?
    answer: Add warm lighting, soft textiles, and a few lighter tones to balance all that earthy goodness.

Rustic is one of those styles that doesn’t need to try hard. It just *is*. It’s the design version of chopping wood with your bare hands, then sitting down with a hot mug of something by the fire. It’s rough around the edges in the best way — like a favorite pair of boots or that old quilt that’s been through every season of your life.

A rustic room isn’t sterile or staged. It’s layered with things that have a little age, a little texture, maybe even a story. Reclaimed wood is everywhere — on the floors, the beams, the [coffee table](/glossary/coffee-table) that might’ve once been part of a barn. You’ll find stone too — maybe a fireplace with real heft, not just some lightweight veneer pretending to be tough.

Colors stay close to the earth: deep browns, burnt oranges, slate grays, warm creams. Nothing too cool or polished. If it feels like something you’d find in a forest or a field, you’re on the right track. Textures are the secret weapon — raw wood, nubby linen, chunky knits, maybe some [leather](/glossary/leather) that’s seen a few lives. The more touchable it is, the better.

[Lighting](/glossary/category/lighting-design) tends to be warm and low — think wrought iron fixtures, [Edison bulbs](/glossary/edison-bulb), maybe a [lantern-style pendant](/glossary/pendant-light). You want everything to glow, not glare.

And rustic doesn’t mean cluttered. It’s not [maximalist](/glossary/maximalist). But it’s not [minimalist](/glossary/minimalist) either. It’s that perfect in-between where everything feels chosen, but never fussy. A couple vintage finds, maybe a hand-thrown ceramic bowl, a wool throw slung casually (but artfully) across a sofa.

At the end of the day, rustic design is about grounding. It doesn’t chase trends. It’s not trying to impress. It just wants you to take a deep breath, slow down, and stay a while. Preferably with a dog snoring nearby.

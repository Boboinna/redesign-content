faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between an armchair and an accent chair?
    answer: All armchairs have arms (duh), but not all accent chair do. Accent chairs are more about looks; armchairs are about sinking in and staying a while.
  - question: Can an armchair go in a bedroom?
    answer: Absolutely. Throw one in the corner with a lamp and boom — instant reading nook slash laundry pile zone.
  - question: Are armchairs good for small spaces?
    answer: They can be! Look for slim arms and legs to keep things airy. Avoid anything that looks like it could eat you alive.
  - question: Should my armchair match my sofa?
    answer: Only if you’re going for “catalog” vibes. Mix it up for personality. Think of it like fashion — coordinated, not copy-pasted.

There’s something oddly powerful about having a chair that’s just for you. Not a couch that invites everyone. Not a stool that barely counts. No — the armchair is the room’s version of saying, “This is mine. I’m sitting here. Permanently.”

It’s the place you plop into with a mug of tea after pretending to clean. It’s where you rewatch old sitcoms and spiral into online shopping. It’s where pets mysteriously gravitate, like they know it’s the coziest seat in the house. And it’s often the chair you argue over when guests arrive. (If you know, you know.)

The shape has range too. Some armchairs are all plush and oversized, like a cloud got serious about [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures). Others are sleek and [mid-century](/glossary/mid-century-modern), for people who drink espresso and say “curated.” Tufted, [wingback](/glossary/wingback-chair), swivel, [recliner](/glossary/recliner) — it’s a choose-your-own-comfort adventure.

And the best part? An armchair doesn’t have to match anything. In fact, it kind of lives to stand out. Patterned fabric? Sure. [Vintage velvet](/glossary/velvet)? Go off. Something that looks like you dragged it out of a grandparent’s den and gave it a second life? That’s the magic.

Armchairs are solo moments. They’re invitations to sit down and stay a while — not with everyone else, not at the table, but in your own little corner of comfort. Whether you read in it, cry in it, or just scroll TikTok until your leg goes numb… the armchair’s got you.

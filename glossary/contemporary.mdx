faq:
  - question: Isn’t that just modern design?
    answer: Not quite. Modern design is a specific era. Contemporary is a moving target — it changes with the times.
  - question: What does a contemporary space actually look like?
    answer: Clean lines, open space, neutral tones with the occasional bold moment. It’s less “designed” and more “edited.”
  - question: Can I mix it with other styles?
    answer: Definitely. Contemporary is chill like that — it plays well with others as long as things stay fresh and uncluttered.
  - question: Is it okay if I don’t update it constantly?
    answer: Totally okay. You don’t need to redecorate every trend cycle. If it still feels fresh to you, you’re good.

Contemporary design is kind of like fashion for your house — always paying attention to what’s current, but not in a desperate way. It’s not about chasing every new trend, it’s about curating a space that feels right *right now*.

If [modern](/glossary/modern) design is [mid-century](/glossary/mid-century-modern) and stuck in time (in a good way), contemporary is more of a shapeshifter. It’s always evolving. Today’s version might be full of soft [neutrals](/glossary/neutrals) and oversized art. A few years from now? Who knows — maybe it’s [earth tones](/glossary/earth-tones) and [sculptural lighting](/glossary/sculptural-lighting).

But one thing’s consistent: it’s clean. Not in a sterile, doctor’s-office kind of way — more like a well-edited Instagram post. Lines are smooth. Clutter is basically banned. [Color](/glossary/category/colors) palettes tend to lean [neutral](/glossary/neutrals) (grays, creams, maybe black), but there’s usually one dramatic detail — a red [accent chair](/glossary/accent-chair), a funky lamp, a weird-but-awesome [coffee table](/glossary/coffee-table) — just to keep things interesting.

Contemporary interiors usually feel open. Airy. Almost like the [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) is giving you space to think. There’s an intentionality to it — like every piece was chosen because it earns its keep. It’s less “I just bought a bunch of stuff” and more “I thought about this.”

The best part? It’s not bossy. You can mix in a little [boho](/glossary/bohemian), a dash of [industrial](/glossary/industrial) or even something vintage, and as long as the vibe stays clean and cohesive, it still counts as contemporary. It’s basically the cool friend who’s always on trend, but never gatekeeps.

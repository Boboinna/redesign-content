faq:
  - question: Is coastal design the same as beachy or nautical?
    answer: Not exactly. It’s more laid-back and light-filled than nautical — think less anchors, more linen curtains and driftwood.
  - question: Do I need to live near the ocean to pull this off?
    answer: Nope! Coastal design is a vibe, not a zip code. You can bring the beachy calm to a city apartment or a landlocked cottage.
  - question: What colors define coastal interiors?
    answer: Soft whites, sandy beiges, seafoam greens, and ocean blues — basically, anything that makes you exhale.
  - question: How do I avoid the cheesy beach-house look?
    answer: Ditch the seashell lamps. Focus on natural textures, easygoing fabrics, and tones that feel sun-washed, not themed.

Coastal design isn’t trying to be cool — it just *is*. It’s that undone, effortless kind of style that feels like someone opened all the windows and let the ocean wander through the house with bare feet and no agenda.

You walk in, and it’s like the air’s lighter. The palette is soft and relaxed — lots of white, [warm neutrals](/glossary/neutrals) and washed-out blues or greens that feel like they’ve been sitting in the sun. It’s never too matchy, never too perfect. You’ll see slipcovered [sofas](/glossary/sofa), wicker chairs and floors that are meant to be walked on barefoot. Everything looks like it could survive a spilled margarita and still vibe.

Coastal isn’t just about how it looks — it’s how it feels. Breezy, breathable, unbothered. Linen and cotton rule the fabric game. [Wood](/glossary/wood-types) is usually pale or weathered, like it’s been bleached by saltwater and time. Rugs are often jute or sisal, because texture matters more than polish.

There’s a ton of [natural light](/glossary/natural-lighting), or at least the illusion of it. If your space doesn’t get beachy sun, fake it with sheer curtains and layered lighting. Coastal style is all about clarity — no clutter, no drama, just a place where your brain can chill.

And sure, you *can* have a little driftwood moment or a print of the sea if you want — just skip the over-the-top “beach life” signs and fake starfish. Real coastal design doesn’t need to remind you of the ocean every five minutes. It just kind of... lets you feel it.

Basically, if your home feels like a place where time slows down, where shoes are optional, and where every room practically hands you a cold drink — you nailed it.

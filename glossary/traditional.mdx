faq:
  - question: Does traditional mean old and boring?
    answer: Only if you think Jane Austen is boring. It's more about character and comfort than being “old.”
  - question: Can I add modern stuff to a traditional room?
    answer: Sure. Just don’t throw in a neon lava lamp and expect it to vibe.
  - question: What makes a room feel traditional?
    answer: Symmetry, rich colors, classic furniture, and the sense that someone probably serves tea here at 3 p.m.
  - question: Does everything need to match?
    answer: Not exactly, but traditional loves balance. It’s the style version of “everything in its right place.”

Traditional design feels like walking into a room where someone definitely owns cloth napkins and knows how to use them. It's not flashy, it’s not chasing trends and it doesn't care what TikTok says is in this week. It just is. Solid. Steady. Wears a blazer but also keeps cookies in a tin somewhere nearby.

There’s a kind of quiet confidence in traditional spaces. You walk in and nothing screams at you. The furniture isn’t trying to be edgy. It’s just... reliable. Maybe there’s a deep, [tufted sofa](/glossary/sofa) you sort of sink into. Maybe a big wooden [coffee table](/glossary/coffee-table) with a few dings that tell you people actually live here. There's usually some symmetry going on — lamps flanking a couch, a couple of matching chairs by the fireplace, art hung in pairs or neat little grids. Everything feels balanced, like the room took a deep breath.

[Colors](/glossary/category/colors) tend to hang out in the warm and cozy zone. Not [beige](/glossary/beige) in a boring way, more like taupe, navy, forest green, burgundy — those deep, grounding shades that feel like a wool blanket on a cold day. Patterns? Oh, they're around. Florals, stripes, maybe a little damask if the wallpaper is feeling fancy.

Traditional doesn’t mean uptight. It just has good posture. It’s that friend who sends handwritten thank-you notes and somehow knows how to fold a fitted sheet. It’s inviting, but it also remembers to light the candles before guests come over.

And the thing is — traditional design lasts. Trends will come and go (looking at you, inflatable furniture of the '90s), but traditional stays rooted. It evolves, sure, but it doesn’t lose its soul in the process.

So if you want your space to feel like home in the most classic sense — layered, lived-in, and maybe a little nostalgic — traditional’s already fluffing the pillows for you.

faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between modern and contemporary design?
    answer: Modern design refers to a specific era (think early-to-mid 1900s), while contemporary is whatever’s trendy right now. Basically, modern is your grandpa’s cool college apartment — contemporary is your friend’s Instagram renovation.
  - question: Can modern interiors feel warm and cozy?
    answer: 100%. Just throw in some natural textures — like wood, leather, wool — and avoid going full sterile spaceship mode.
  - question: What’s a typical modern color palette?
    answer: Mostly neutrals like white, black, gray, and beige — but sometimes you’ll see a bold pop, like mustard or teal, to keep things interesting.
  - question: Is modern the same as minimalist?
    answer: Nope. They’re close cousins, but modern isn’t quite as strict. minimalist is like, “Do you really need that chair?” then modern says, “Sure, you can have the chair, just make it sleek and functional.”

Modern interior design isn’t actually “modern” in the way most people think. It’s not trendy. It’s not futuristic. It’s not full of [chrome](/glossary/chrome) robots and voice-controlled everything (though hey, live your truth). Modern design actually came out of the early 20th century — you know, back when people were like, “Let’s get rid of all the unnecessary stuff and just keep what works.” Groundbreaking.

So what does that look like in a room? Clean lines. Smooth surfaces. [Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) that isn’t trying too hard. Think of a [living room](/glossary/living-room) where everything has its place, nothing is fussy, and there’s this underlying feeling of, “Ahhh, I can breathe in here.” That’s modern.

But don’t confuse it with cold or lifeless. A lot of people hear “modern” and immediately picture those all-white showrooms where you’re scared to sit down. No no — real modern design can be warm, cozy, and totally livable. You’ll find a comfy leather [sofa](/glossary/sofa), a [wood credenza](/glossary/credenza) with some soul, maybe a sleek [floor lamp](/glossary/floor-lamp) that looks like it belongs in an art gallery but also just, you know, gives you light.

Modern spaces love neutral [colors](/glossary/category/colors) — [whites](/glossary/white), [beiges](/glossary/beige), [grays](/glossary/gray) — but they’re not afraid of a bold accent. One well-placed piece of art or a sculptural chair can do a lot in an otherwise chill space. It’s less about “Look at all this stuff I have” and more about “Look how intentional this room feels.”

And if you're someone who needs your space to feel calm, uncluttered, and just a little bit grown up (even if you still eat dinner on the couch most nights), modern might be your thing. It’s that rare combo of timeless and low-maintenance — which, let’s be honest, is pretty hard to beat.

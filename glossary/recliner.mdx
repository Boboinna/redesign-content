faq:
  - question: Are recliners ugly or just misunderstood?
    answer: Depends who you ask. To some, they’re aesthetic crimes. To others, they’re life-saving lumbar support with cup holders. We say embrace the cozy chaos.
  - question: How much space does a recliner need?
    answer: More than you think. Make sure there’s enough room behind it to fully lean back — unless you enjoy punching walls mid-nap.
  - question: Can recliners be stylish?
    answer: Yes! Today’s recliners come in sleek silhouettes, leather or linen, and won’t scream “man cave circa 1998.” We’ve evolved.
  - question: Manual or electric?
    answer: Manual’s great for simplicity. Electric is for the drama. If you want to recline like royalty with one button, go electric.

There’s something deeply personal about a recliner. Like, people don’t just sit in them — they *commit* to them. It becomes *their* chair. Their kingdom. Their sacred spot where nobody else is allowed to sit unless specifically invited by royal decree.

At its core, a recliner is just a chair that lets you lean back and put your feet up. But emotionally? It’s so much more. It’s where you go when the day’s been long and your back is screaming. Where you binge entire seasons, snore halfway through movies, and occasionally pretend to read.

The classic image? Big, puffy, often brown — the kind of chair your dad claimed as his own and practically left an imprint in. But recliners have grown up. You can now get one that *doesn’t* look like it belongs in a 90s sitcom set. Think: slim arms, clean lines, modern fabrics. Some even swivel, rock or massage (which is basically a full spa moment in chair form).

They come in different styles — wall-hugger, rocker, push-back, power lift. Whichever direction you go, comfort is kind of non-negotiable. This is a chair designed for your most dramatic flops.

And hey, even if your inner design critic wants to judge it, your lower back probably has different priorities.

A recliner doesn’t ask for much. Just some space to stretch and a person who understands the art of lounging. So pull the lever (or push the button) and surrender to gravity.

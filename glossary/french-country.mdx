faq:
  - question: What even *is* French Country style?
    answer: It’s basically the comfy, kind of rustic look from rural France — where everything’s a bit worn, cozy, and feels like it’s been in the family for years.
  - question: What colors are typical here?
    answer: Soft creams and whites, faded blues and greens, plus dusty pinks and yellows that don’t hit you over the head.
  - question: Do I have to find old antiques?
    answer: Nah, it’s more about stuff that feels like it has a story — doesn’t have to be a real antique.
  - question: What materials scream French Country?
    answer: Think rough wood, stone floors, linen that’s soft but not fancy, some wrought iron, and ceramics that look a bit handmade.

French Country is like the ultimate “come sit down and stay awhile” kind of vibe. Imagine walking into a house in the French countryside where the [wood](/glossary/wood-types) beams overhead creak just enough to remind you this place has history — but it’s not trying to be fancy or perfect.

The floors might be old stone or [wood](/glossary/wood-types) that’s got scratches and dents but feels solid and welcoming. You’re not in a showroom; you’re in a home that’s been lived in and loved.

Colors here are chill. Creamy whites and [warm neutrals](/glossary/neutrals) make the walls feel soft, while faded blues and greens add that little pop without being too wild. They’re the colors of sun-bleached fabrics and fields of lavender, relaxed and easygoing.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) is sturdy and comfy — a big wooden table scarred from years of family dinners, chairs with woven seats, maybe a dresser that’s been passed down through generations. Nothing shiny or new. This is about personality, not perfection.

Decor is a little bit of everything that feels personal: fresh flowers in simple vases, linen curtains that move with the breeze, woven baskets, and maybe some [ceramics](/glossary/ceramic-vessels) that look handmade or a little rough around the edges. A wrought iron [chandelier](/glossary/chandelier) overhead might add some rustic romance, but nothing flashy.

At its heart, French Country is about slowing down. It’s the smell of fresh bread in the oven, the feel of soft linen sheets, and the sound of laughter echoing through a sunlit kitchen.

If your home feels like a big, warm hug that’s been waiting for you all day, then congratulations — you’re living French Country.

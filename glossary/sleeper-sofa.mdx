faq:
  - question: Is a sleeper sofa comfortable to sleep on?
    answer: Comfort levels vary, but the good ones can absolutely pass for a decent bed. Just don’t expect five-star luxury unless you splurge a little.
  - question: What’s the difference between a futon and a sleeper sofa?
    answer: A futon lays flat like it’s passed out from exhaustion. A sleeper sofa usually hides a fold-out mattress inside, like a sneaky surprise.
  - question: Can I use a sleeper sofa every night as a bed?
    answer: You *can*, but should you? Maybe not. It's great for guests or short-term use, but for every-night sleeping, your spine might stage a protest.
  - question: Do all sleeper sofas have that metal bar of doom?
    answer: Thankfully, not anymore. Modern versions are ditching the medieval torture bar for memory foam and trifold mattresses. Progress!

You know that moment when someone says, “Oh, don’t worry — you can just crash on the couch”? This is the couch they *wish* they meant. A sleeper sofa is what happens when a couch decides it’s ready for bigger responsibilities. It’s tired of being just a place to snack and nap — it wants to *host*.

At first glance, it looks like your regular ol’ couch. Nothing suspicious. But give it a tug, flip the cushions, and *bam* — mattress. Sometimes full, sometimes queen, sometimes the kind where you roll into the middle and question all your life choices. But still — it’s a bed. In a [sofa](/glossary/sofa). That’s cool.

Sleeper sofas are lifesavers in tight spaces. If you’re in a studio apartment, have a guest room that moonlights as an office, or just host the occasional tipsy friend who can’t make it home, this is your MVP. They come in tons of styles now — from sleek, [Scandi](/glossary/scandinavian) vibes to those plush, sink-in numbers with storage for extra bedding.

Let’s be real though — they’ve come a long way from their lumpy ancestors. No more springs attacking your ribs in the middle of the night. No more wrestling with unfolding mechanisms like you’re in a WWE match. Modern sleeper sofas actually *want* you to enjoy them.

And hey, maybe it’s not the Ritz. But when your in-laws show up “just for a night” or your friend needs a crash pad after trivia night turned into tequila night — this thing earns its keep.

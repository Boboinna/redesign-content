faq:
  - question: Does everything have to be vintage or thrifted?
    answer: Not at all. Mix what you love. New stuff can totally live alongside that flea market mirror you dragged home in the rain.
  - question: Can Bohemian design still feel organized?
    answer: Yes — there’s a method to the madness. Group by color, layer with purpose and trust your gut.
  - question: Isn’t Bohemian just clutter?
    answer: Nope. It’s curated chaos. If it tells a story, sparks a memory or makes you feel something, it earns its place.
  - question: What colors define Boho interiors?
    answer: Warm tones, earthy shades, jewel tones — basically, everything but bland. The vibe is rich, global and unafraid.

Bohemian design is what happens when your room decides to take a deep breath, toss the rulebook out the window and pick up a passport. It’s the exact opposite of sterile — full of soul, stories and stuff you didn’t even know you loved until it found a place in your home.

This style isn’t about perfection. In fact, if something’s too matchy-matchy, it starts to feel suspiciously un-Boho. It’s all about layers: textures stacked on textures, patterns dancing across the floor and walls, art leaned instead of hung, and a general sense that this space has lived a little. Or a lot.

The color palette? Anything goes, but it tends to lean warm and rich. Think deep reds, golden ochres, dusty pinks and emerald greens. Neutrals show up too, mostly to balance out the visual party that’s happening everywhere else.

You’ll find natural [materials](/glossary/category/materials-and-finishes) all over the place — [rattan](/glossary/rattan), [wood](/glossary/wood-types), jute, linen, [leather](/glossary/leather) — and usually in ways that feel slightly undone (in the best way). A woven pendant lamp. A hand-me-down dresser with paint chipping just enough to look cool. A pile of [throw pillows](/glossary/throw-pillows) that make sitting on the floor feel like an invitation, not a punishment.

Plants? Everywhere. Bohemian homes are basically jungles with Wi-Fi. Hanging plants, leafy corner monsters, tiny cacti on sunlit shelves — they breathe life into the space (literally) and soften all the visual noise.

And don’t forget the global influence. You’ll see Moroccan rugs, Indian block prints, [Turkish poufs](/glossary/poufs), and maybe a framed postcard from a market in Oaxaca. It’s eclectic, yes, but not random. Every item feels *found*, not bought.

The best part? There are no real rules. If it makes you happy, it belongs. That painting you made at 2AM? Put it up. The scarf from your grandmother? Drape it over a chair. The chipped ceramic mug you found on a road trip? Give it a home on your windowsill.

Bohemian is about living in your space like it’s a journal — messy in places, deeply personal, and always evolving.

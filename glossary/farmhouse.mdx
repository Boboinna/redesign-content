faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between Farmhouse and Rustic?
    answer: Rustic is a little rougher around the edges. Farmhouse is softer, more polished, and more likely to have throw pillows that say ‘gather’.
  - question: Is Farmhouse outdated?
    answer: Not at all. It evolves — modern farmhouse is still going strong, with cleaner lines and less “rooster art.”
  - question: Can I mix farmhouse with other styles?
    answer: Absolutely. It plays surprisingly well with boho, industrial, even minimalist (hello, Modern Farmhouse).

Farmhouse design is like that favorite old flannel shirt — soft, comfortable, slightly worn in and full of character. It doesn’t try too hard. It doesn’t need to. It just feels like home.

At its core, Farmhouse is all about comfort and functionality with a big side of charm. You’ll find weathered [wood](/glossary/wood-types), vintage finds, big comfy [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) and a general feeling that life is meant to be *lived* in this space — like, spill-the-soup-and-laugh-about-it lived.

Let’s talk [color](/glossary/category/colors). Farmhouse doesn’t scream. It murmurs in [soft neutrals](/glossary/neutrals) — [creamy whites](/glossary/white), [soft grays](/glossary/gray), [warm beiges](/glossary/beige). Occasionally, you’ll spot a faded sage or dusty navy, but everything feels slightly sun-washed. Like it’s been aging beautifully for years.

[Materials](/glossary/category/materials-and-finishes)? Natural and humble. [Reclaimed wood](/glossary/wood-types) beams. Galvanized metal light fixtures. Linen curtains that flutter just a little when the window’s open. Maybe a stone fireplace or some [exposed brick](/glossary/exposed-brick) that gives the space a grounded, earthy feel. Nothing is too shiny, too sleek, or too precious.

And the [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures)? It’s big, cozy, and often slipcovered — because *practicality* is the love language here. A deep sofa you can nap on. A farmhouse table that’s seen both birthday cakes and report cards. It’s a mix of old and new, and it’s okay if things don’t match perfectly. In fact, it’s better if they don’t.

Accessories are where Farmhouse really tells its story. Vintage finds, wire baskets, enamel pitchers, maybe a stack of worn cookbooks that you swear you’re going to open one day. And yes, you can have your “farm fresh eggs” sign. You’ve earned it.

Farmhouse isn’t just a style — it’s a *feeling*. It’s Sunday pancakes. It’s barefoot dinners on the porch. It’s the kind of space that invites you to slow down, stay awhile, and maybe kick your feet up on the coffee table (which is probably an old trunk, by the way).

So no, you don’t need an actual farm. You just need a home that feels like one.

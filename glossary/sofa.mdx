faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between a sofa and a couch?
    answer: Technically? Nothing huge. “Sofa” sounds fancier, “couch” feels more casual. Use whichever makes you feel more emotionally supported.
  - question: How big should my sofa be?
    answer: Big enough to fit your people and your problems. Kidding. (Kind of.) Just make sure it fits your space — and leaves room to actually walk around it.
  - question: Can I put a sofa in a small room?
    answer: Absolutely. Go for a sleek silhouette, light fabric and visible legs to keep it feeling airy instead of heavy.
  - question: What fabric is best?
    answer: Depends on your lifestyle. Kids and pets? Performance fabric. Solo Netflix enthusiast with wine glass in hand? Maybe something velvet and dramatic. Live your truth.

Let’s be honest — the sofa is where life happens. It’s where you fall asleep mid-episode, where guests inevitably end up despite your careful [dining table](/glossary/dining-table) arrangement and where your dog has decided he owns the left cushion (you lost that battle months ago).

A sofa is more than [furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures). It’s an experience. It’s personality. It says, “I read books” or “I host wine nights” or “I definitely bought this in a panic from a warehouse sale and now we live with it.” Whatever your story, your sofa’s in it.

There are endless types: [sectionals](/glossary/sectional) for sprawling, [loveseats](/glossary/loveseat) for tight spaces, [modular ones](/glossary/modular-sofa) you can rearrange like a design puzzle. You’ve got deep-seat [loungers](/glossary/lounge-chair) that feel like marshmallows, and firm [mid-century](/glossary/mid-century-modern) ones that say “I’m stylish, but we sit up straight here.”

[Color](/glossary/category/colors) and texture are half the vibe. A buttery [leather](/glossary/leather) sofa gives that “cool loft” energy. A cream [boucle](/glossary/boucle) says, “I don’t have toddlers.” A bold jewel-tone [velvet](/glossary/velvet)? That’s main-character energy. Throw some pillows at it (literally and emotionally) and it instantly becomes yours.

The best part? Sofas don’t have to be precious. In fact, they’re better when they’ve been lived in — when the cushions know the shape of your body and the fabric has a tiny coffee stain that you *swear* looks like abstract art.

So go ahead. Flop on it. Eat dinner on it. Rearrange your entire [living room](/glossary/living-room) around it like a maniac at 2AM because it “just didn’t feel right.” The sofa gets it. That’s why it’s the real MVP.

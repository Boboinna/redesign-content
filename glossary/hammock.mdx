faq:
  - question: Can you hang a hammock inside your apartment?
    answer: Yes, but make sure you’re not just drilling into drywall unless you enjoy sudden gravity-based lessons.
  - question: What’s the best material for a hammock?
    answer: Depends on the vibe — cotton is comfy, nylon is light and good for camping, and rope looks cool but might leave butt imprints.
  - question: Can you sleep in a hammock full-time?
    answer: People do. You’ll either wake up feeling reborn or like a pretzel. There’s no in-between.
  - question: Do I need trees to use a hammock?
    answer: Not at all. Stands exist. Walls work too if you're brave (and good with anchors).

Let’s be real: the hammock is peak anti-effort. It’s what you crawl into when you’re done pretending to be productive. It’s not a chair. It’s not a bed. It’s a fabric cloud you can swing in, drift off in, or just lay there while your brain does that thing where it loops the same thought 300 times until it doesn’t.

There’s no elegant way to get into a hammock. You kind of lunge and hope for the best. Sometimes you spin. Sometimes you fall. But once you’re in — oh, it’s worth it. It hugs you like it knows you’ve been through some stuff. And yeah, maybe you look a little ridiculous, but so does everyone. That’s the deal.

People try to fancy up hammocks. They’ll use words like “ergonomic” or “boho-chic.” But the truth is, it’s just a sling of fabric (or net, or rope) that says, “Hey, take a break.” It doesn’t ask for much. A couple trees. Maybe a stand. Maybe a good playlist and a breeze.

And it works pretty much anywhere — a backyard, a [balcony](/glossary/balcony), the middle of the [living room](/glossary/living-room) if you don’t care what your landlord thinks. It’s chaos furniture in the best way. And once you’re in it, gently swaying like a burrito on a string, you kind of get it. Life doesn’t need to be so serious.

Hammocks: because the floor is overrated.

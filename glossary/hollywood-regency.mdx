faq:
  - question: What is Hollywood Regency, exactly?
    answer: It’s the interior design version of a red carpet moment—glamorous, polished, and not afraid to be the center of attention.
  - question: How is it different from Art Deco?
    answer: While both are glamorous, Hollywood Regency is softer and more playful. Art Deco is structured and bold; Hollywood Regency is dramatic but with a wink.
  - question: Can I do Hollywood Regency on a budget?
    answer: Yes! Thrifted mirrors, faux fur throws, and a spray can of gold paint go a long way.
  - question: Is it okay to mix patterns?
    answer: Please do. Leopard with stripes? Velvet with lacquer? If it feels risky but fabulous, you’re doing it right.

Okay, so imagine if your [living room](/glossary/living-room) dressed up for a black-tie event but still wanted to dance barefoot by midnight. That’s Hollywood Regency. It’s [maximalism](/glossary/maximalist) with a stylist. It’s luxe without being stuffy. Basically, it’s what happens when elegance and fun have a baby—and that baby is wearing a silk turban.

This style came out of the golden age of Hollywood—when movie stars were *movie stars*, and their homes needed to look like you could film a musical number in them at any moment. It’s unapologetically glamorous, loves attention and isn’t afraid to go bold.

We’re talking high contrast everything: black and [white](/glossary/white) floors, deep navy walls with crisp white trim, mirrors on mirrors on mirrors. Reflective surfaces are a big deal here. The more your room sparkles in the light, the better. If it doesn’t glint, does it even belong?

[Materials](/glossary/category/materials-and-finishes)? Go plush. [Velvet](/glossary/velvet), lacquer, silk, faux fur. Gold and [chrome](/glossary/chrome) show up like they own the place (because they kind of do). Lucite is welcome. So is anything that could pass for a vintage perfume bottle.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) has curves. Think: scalloped edges, tufted backs, bold silhouettes. Nothing shy, nothing meek. And [color](/glossary/category/colors)? It’s either classic and [monochrome](/glossary/monochrome) or wild and rich. Emerald green, hot pink, sapphire blue—all fair game, especially when paired with high-gloss black or bright [white](/glossary/white).

And the accessories? Drama. Think oversized lamps, giant statement art, Greek busts, fringe, animal print, crystal trays holding three perfectly arranged lipstick tubes. More is more—but make it *intentional*.

Hollywood Regency is the moment. It doesn’t whisper. It struts. If [minimalism](/glossary/minimalist) is a yoga retreat, Hollywood Regency is a champagne-fueled afterparty with Edith Head and a Great Dane named Valentino.

So if you’ve ever looked at your room and thought, “What if this had just a little more sparkle?”—go ahead and toss on a feathered robe and start decorating. The spotlight’s already waiting.

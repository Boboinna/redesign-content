Art Deco is not here to play it safe. It shows up in a silk robe, pours itself a cocktail and lounges on a [velvet chaise](/glossary/velvet) like it owns the place — because honestly, it kind of does. Born in the 1920s and 30s, this design style was all about progress, glamour and making everything — *everything* — look like it belonged in a jazz-age cocktail party.

Let’s start with the shapes. Art Deco *loves* geometry. You’ll see bold zigzags, fans, chevrons and sunbursts. Nothing subtle here — this style believes that the world is more fabulous when it's framed in symmetry and a bit of razzle-dazzle. Lines are crisp, angles are sharp and curves (when they do show up) are intentional and often dramatic.

And then there’s the *shine*. [[chrome](/glossary/chrome)](/glossary/chorme), brass, mirrored surfaces — if it reflects light, it belongs. Art Deco interiors are like jewelry boxes you can live inside. Picture a black marble fireplace with gold inlay, or a bar cart that looks like it came off a vintage train headed for Monte Carlo. Opulence is the point.

Color-wise, think jewel tones turned up to eleven. Deep emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red — all anchored by black, white and metallics. It’s rich and bold without being loud. Like the best kind of drama.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) is sculptural and elegant, often featuring luxe materials like lacquered wood, [velvet](/glossary/velvet), and glass. There are no casual pieces in Art Deco — even the coffee table is dressed for a night out. And don’t be surprised if you see a few exotic materials too: shagreen, tortoiseshell, or inlaid ivory — back then, they really went for it.

And yet, there’s balance. Art Deco isn’t messy. It’s curated, calculated, almost architectural in how it brings all its elements together. It’s [maximalism](/glossary/maximalist) with rules — bold, but never chaotic.

So if you love the idea of your home whispering “elegance” with a martini in hand, Art Deco might just be your soulmate. It’s timeless, it’s theatrical and honestly? It knows how to make an entrance.

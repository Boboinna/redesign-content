faq:
  - question: What should I have in a home office?
    answer: A desk, a comfy chair, Wi-Fi that only crashes during Zoom calls, and enough pens to start a small stationery shop.
  - question: How do I stay productive while working from home?
    answer: Trick yourself. Set timers. Put on shoes. And maybe don’t open TikTok “just for a minute.”
  - question: Can a home office be part of another room?
    answer: Absolutely. That tiny corner by your kitchen table? Boom. Office. Just don’t sit too close to the snack cabinet.
  - question: How do I make my home office look good on video calls?
    answer: Add plants, books, or an artsy print behind you. And never sit directly under a ceiling fan unless you’re auditioning for a horror movie.

Ah, the home office. Once a luxury for freelancers and late-night side hustlers — now a global norm that somehow feels both empowering and soul-sucking.

It’s the room (or corner, or shelf-sized nook) where you *try* to get stuff done. Theoretically, it’s a productivity haven. Realistically? It’s the space where you switch between six tabs, forget what day it is, and talk to your dog like he’s your coworker (because he is).

Designing a home office sounds glamorous in theory. Maybe you picture clean lines, a fancy [ergonomic chair](/glossary/ergonomic-chair), and the smell of success wafting in with the [natural light](/glossary/natural-lighting). In practice? There's a stack of unopened mail, a dying houseplant, and a monitor covered in sticky notes reminding you to "hydrate" and "please respond to that one email from three days ago."

Your [desk](/glossary/desk)? Probably a little too small. Your chair? Somehow creaky. Your vibe? Somewhere between “I’ve got this” and “I need a nap.” But hey, that’s the charm of it. It’s yours. No one’s judging your coffee mug collection or that half-eaten snack just out of frame.

And the lines between work and life? Utterly blurred. This is the space where you land new clients, file your taxes, scroll LinkedIn like a spy and sometimes have mini existential crises because your calendar invited you to three meetings you don’t remember accepting.

Whether you’ve got a spare room, a closet-turned-office, or a table you shove your laptop onto when it’s time to clock in — the home office has officially earned its place in the modern home. 

Just don’t forget to stand up and stretch every now and then. Your spine deserves it.

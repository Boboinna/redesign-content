faq:
  - question: What’s the difference between a sectional and a regular sofa?
    answer: A sectional is like a sofa that went to therapy, figured out boundaries, and came back with options. It’s modular, usually bigger, and built to flex around your space.
  - question: Can sectionals work in small rooms?
    answer: Surprisingly, yes. A smaller L-shaped sectional can actually save space by hugging walls and cutting out the need for extra chairs.
  - question: What’s better — L-shape or U-shape?
    answer: Depends on how many people you want to host... or how many corners you want to claim for yourself. L-shape is great for stretching out. U-shape is a conversation pit waiting to happen.
  - question: Can you separate a sectional?
    answer: Yep! Many are modular, so you can reconfigure pieces or take them apart completely — like adult LEGO but comfier.

If [sofas](/glossary/sofa) are your dependable best friend, sectionals are the ride-or-die squad. It’s not just one seat — it’s a *situation*.

The genius of the sectional is in its modular design. It’s made of multiple pieces — think corner units, chaise lounges, armless sections — that fit together like a sofa puzzle. You can mix, match, rearrange and turn it into whatever shape works for your life (and your floor plan chaos).

Hosting a movie night? Everyone gets a spot. Need to lie sideways, diagonally or upside down because you're emotionally dramatic? Covered. Want a cozy nap cocoon where you wake up three hours later confused but satisfied? Oh, it delivers.

They come in all vibes too — clean and modern, plush and overstuffed, [leather](/glossary/leather), [velvet](/glossary/velvet), [neutrals](/glossary/neutrals), color bombs. There's no one way to sectional. Some even have built-in [recliners](/gloossary/recliner) or hidden storage for your remote control graveyard. Dreamy.

Yes, they’re bigger. Yes, they’re kind of a commitment. But once you go sectional, going back to a regular sofa feels like trying to watch Netflix on a flip phone.

This isn’t just seating — it’s a lifestyle. A statement. A declaration that you believe in comfort, community, and having enough space for everyone *and* their emotional baggage.

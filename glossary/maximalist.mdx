faq:
  - question: Isn’t maximalism just clutter?
    answer: Nope. It's curated chaos. Everything’s there on purpose — even if it looks wild.
  - question: Can I mix patterns?
    answer: You’re basically required to. Stripes, florals, leopard print? Toss ’em all on the same sofa.
  - question: Is there such thing as *too much* in maximalism?
    answer: Kind of… but you won’t know until you’ve already crossed that line. And that’s part of the fun.
  - question: Does maximalist mean messy?
    answer: Not at all. It can be super intentional. Just... with more pillows and attitude.

Maximalist design is what happens when you stop editing and start expressing. It’s [color](/glossary/category/colors). It’s texture. It’s five patterns in one room and somehow it still works. It’s the opposite of that “clean girl aesthetic” where everything’s beige and you’re scared to spill coffee on anything. In a maximalist space, coffee *belongs* on that embroidered vintage [velvet](/glossary/velvet). It adds character.

This style is for people who collect — and not just stuff, but stories. The room says: “Oh that? I found it in a thrift shop in Portugal. The table? Flea market. The rug? It’s handwoven and yes, slightly crooked. Isn’t it perfect?” Nothing matches but everything goes.

[Color](/glossary/category/colors) is king here. Bright jewel tones, moody dark walls, clashing shades that somehow become best friends in the right light. You’ll see art — *lots* of it. Gallery walls that keep growing. Books stacked sideways. Trinkets on every surface. Mirrors. Candles. Maybe a plant with a name. (Her name is Susan and she’s thriving, thank you.)

It’s not about being messy. It’s about being bold. Maximalism is controlled chaos. It’s curated. But not in the “Pinterest-perfect” way. More like, “I tried ten [throw blankets](/glossary/throw-blanket) and this is the one that made my soul exhale.” It’s instinctual. You know when it feels right — and you’ll keep adding until it does.

[Furniture](/glossary/category/furniture-and-fixtures) doesn’t have to match. In fact, it really shouldn't. A Victorian [armchair](/glossary/armchair) next to a modern lamp and a [rattan](/glossary/Rattan) [side table](/glossary/side-table)? Yes. That’s the vibe. It’s not a showroom. It’s a life collage.

Maximalist design isn’t for everyone. But if you’ve ever walked into a room and thought, “You know what this needs? A hot pink bar cart and three disco balls,” then this style has been waiting for you. Embrace the drama. The detail. The delightfully extra energy of it all.

Less is more? Not here. More is more. Always has been.
